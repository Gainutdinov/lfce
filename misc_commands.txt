If you don't have systemd, use following to disable a service like 'ufw'
update-rc.d -f ufw remove	(in vagrant vm it didn't work with ufw but worked with nfs-kernel-server)
After above command, I had issues enabling the service nfs-kernel-server for startup. I used following to fix it. 
update-rc.d nfs-kernel-server default
It turns out that inside /etc/init.d/ some files are the services and some are pointing to /lib/init/upstart-job
Following is another way mentioned on internet but didn't work for my vagrant vms. 
echo 'manual' | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override
Here's a summary: 
If service is SysV(Also called init.d): Use 1) 'sudo service nfs-kernel-server stop', 2) 'sudo update-rc.d -f nfs-kernel-server remove' to disable and 'sudo update-rc.d nfs-kernel-server default'	(ntp didn't work)
If service is Upstart: Use 'mv /etc/init/smbd.conf /etc/init/smbc.conf.disabled' and move it back to enable it.
If service is Systemd: Use systemctl enable/disable command. 

When creating Self Signed keys for SSL using openssl, the option -nodes (not decrypted -> maybe) is used to encrpty the private key. If this optin is provided it will ask for passphrase. In case, openssl is used to create key and crt to be used in dovecot ssl, this argument should be used, otherwise you won't be able to connect to mail server.
